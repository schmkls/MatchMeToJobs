# Implementation Notes

This document outlines the implementation details and plan for the MatchMeToJobs backend. The project aims to provide a service for searching companies and, in the future, job listings, and then enriching this data.

In this project we use simple, minimal code and dependencies, and priotize researching for pre-existing libraries rather than implementing logic ourselves.

We dont use fallback methods.

## API Overview

The API enables users to first search for companies using various criteria and then enrich selected companies with detailed information. Future developments will introduce job-related search and scoring functionalities.

### User Flow:

1. User searches for companies via `api/companies/search`.
2. User selects a company from the results.
3. User requests enrichment for the selected company via `api/companies/enrich`.
